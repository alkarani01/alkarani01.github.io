                              <h2 class="mb-4" data-aos="fade-up"> Infection or a <strong>Health Check? </strong></h2>

                              <p class="mb-0" data-aos="fade-up" align="justify">It all started when I bought <strong> giant mushrooms</strong> from a street market in my hometown. It was so unbelievably big that everyone started doubting if it was edible. I was happily cleaning the mushroom when I saw small worms on the inner umbrella of one of the mushrooms. My tribal housemaid saw me deeply observing the mushroom. She casually told me in the local language that <strong>“the mushroom lost the fight”</strong>. I couldn’t understand at once and looked at her blankly when she repeated it a few more times. Then suddenly it clicked my mind and I had a <strong>‘Eureka’ </strong>moment as if I got the answers to all my long awaiting questions. She was saying that the infecting organisms are everywhere and were present around all the mushrooms. But the mushroom which lost the fight got dominated and became the host of those worms.</p>

                           <p class="mb-0" data-aos="fade-up" align="justify">The complete removal of foreign organisms from the environment is impossible and unnatural. We are supposed to be living with all kinds of organisms because if an organism is <strong>pathogenic or not is a species-specific idea</strong>. If we see closely then all the species are fighting with some or other species in some or other way. But this doesn’t mean that one species will completely eliminate the other. So maybe this is a natural phenomenon to target the weak cells and remove them from the system. To understand this, we need to have a broader vision and a neutral mindset for all the living beings on this planet. When I explored more about this idea, I found some more researchers pointing out in the same direction. The infected state is not always a bad state and there are many positive things happening within us during infection. Those human-specific pathogenic organisms are trying to target the weak cells in our body to create space for new ones.<br><br>

                           A very important fact is that all the microbes that are called pathogenic to humans are an inherent part of the <strong>ecosystem</strong>. Our complete body is also called an ecosystem of 37.2 trillion cells working in harmony. Similarly, every microbe is also required to make the balance in the ecosystem by performing specialized functions. One of the postulated roles in the human body is to clear off unhealthy cells and adjust the body's immune system. Therefore, the body let the microbes infect the unhealthy cells and use healthy ones to do the repair. When the body cells are completely healthy then we live with the same microbes in harmony.<br><br>
                         
                            Is it hard to believe or you have already thought about it? I would like to hear from you if you have ever experienced a positive outcome after your recovery from an illness.<br><br>

                            This is thought-provoking but the evidence is everywhere. We just need to use a different eye to see infections as a health check routine.</p>

                              <h2 class="mb-4" data-aos="fade-up"> Embrace the <strong> Uniqueness </strong></h2>

                              <p class="mb-0" data-aos="fade-up" align="justify">The past few years have been tough on many and I am one of them. Post PhD, I was missing my work so badly that I started working as a freelancer to be in touch with science which is my passion. I was done with applying for PDF fellowships and lost in understanding of the biotech job market in my country. I heard many stories, took several pieces of advice from people already working in the biotech companies and approached countless people for recommendations. All this was sucking my soul away as I was going away from my passion and getting lost in the haze of the so-called <strong>“corporate world”.</strong> <br><br>
                            When I calmed myself down, I realized I was not alone and many PhDs are feeling the same no matter in which phase of their career they are. <br><br>Many career counsellors are nowadays trying to help PhDs to join industries but they solely blame PhDs for their condition. It might be true but not fair. This is like blaming an athlete for not being able to walk slow with the crowd.<br><br>
                            Not everyone has studied management, those who have, are the ones to understand the strengths and weaknesses of every degree and how to utilize it in managing a company. If we really want PhDs to sync with everyone else for bigger transformations then they must be accepted for their uniqueness. I am emphasizing here some of the issues that make me feel extremely uncomfortable to hear and experience.<br><br>
                            <strong>•  They are groomed differently:</strong> PhDs might be lacking the potential to market themselves or understand the requirements of the industrial sector but that’s not their fault. They are trained to be self-critical due to which they feel less confident when highlighting themselves (even when they are Nobel laureates).<br>
                            <strong>•   They are not their techniques:</strong> PhDs are researchers and not technicians who should be hired only for their technical expertise. We must not forget that they are the ones who invent techniques out of nowhere to get the desired result.<br>
                            <strong>•   They cannot be concise:</strong> They are the people who go into details and work with those details which must be treated as their strength. So, expecting a short and concise answer is not their forte.</p>

                            <div class="full-image text-center" data-aos="zoom-in" style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px">
                              <img src="images/article1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="interview process">
                        </div>

                            <p class="mb-0" data-aos="fade-up" align="justify"><strong>•   They are the passionate:</strong> They are those driven people who left every pleasure in this world to be a PhD. It's their passion which makes them compromise even their salary or position to work in their area of interest. Their passion must not be taken as their weakness and lack of competitiveness.<br>
                            <strong>•   They are the asset:</strong> They are trained to be a scientist. In the real world if they have compromised on that dream and settled for your company then they must be valued and appointed for their unique abilities. They will be the ones in your company to wait for that last approach when everyone else will give up.<br><br>
                            I always thought writing critically about an issue might give a wrong impression about me and I might be judged for being rude. I was wrong and now I am willing to embrace my uniqueness. I would want to be a part of a team where my critical thinking is appreciated.<br><br>
                            I would like to hear more from you when you felt unaccepted or criticized for something you know is your strength and makes you unique.<br><br>
                            How else we can call ourselves intellectuals! <br><br></p>
